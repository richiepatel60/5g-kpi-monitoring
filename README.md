### Project Summary
Project Name : 5G KPI Monitoring System

The 5G KPI Monitoring System is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to monitor, analyze, and visualize key performance indicators in 5G network environments. Built with React and Flask, this system offers real-time tracking of crucial network metrics including download/upload speeds, latency, and packet loss across different cell locations. The application features an intuitive dashboard with interactive charts powered by Recharts, allowing network administrators to visualize performance trends and identify potential issues promptly. With its automated alert system, the platform actively monitors packet loss rates and notifies users when thresholds are exceeded, enabling proactive network management. The system combines a modern React frontend with a robust Python/Flask backend, utilizing MySQL for reliable data storage and retrieval. This solution streamlines 5G network monitoring workflows by providing both manual data entry capabilities and automated data collection, making it an essential tool for maintaining optimal network performance and ensuring service quality in 5G deployments.
